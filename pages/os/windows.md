# OS Setup
## Get base OS
1. Download a Windows install disk/media you would like to install.
    For home - Microsoft offers the Windows 11 ISO for download at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11
    For enterprise customers - your volume license portal can provide this.
2. Mount the ISO by double clicking on it
3. Copy the contents of the virtual disk drive to a folder you would like the clients to download from such as `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\windows` or  `/var/srv/windows`

# Optional
## Add drivers if needed
1. See [Microsofts guide for adding drivers to an offline image.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/add-and-remove-drivers-to-an-offline-windows-image?view=windows-11#add-driver-packages-to-an-offline-windows-image) use the "boot.wim" image for adding driver support to the installer wizard portion and "install.wim" for the OS that is installed to disk. Drivers may be needed for both.

## Enable boot menu
The below will need a windows machine. This will allow running the Microsoft memory diagnostic or booting multiple WIMs.

1. Run the below command, you should see a "The operation completed successfully." message.
`bcdedit /set "{bootmgr}" displaybootmenu yes /store bcd`

Right column is whether it was on the ISO I was able to boot from as a reference of what may be needed. The items with a ðŸ”µ exist on the reference ISO but are not required to boot.
